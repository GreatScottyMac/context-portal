### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To contribute code, you'll need to set up a development environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/context-portal.git
    cd context-portal
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    Using `uv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
    # .venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows Command Prompt
    # .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows PowerShell
    ```
    Using standard `venv`:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv # Or 'python -m venv .venv'
    source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
    # .venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows Command Prompt
    # .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows PowerShell
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated:
    Using `uv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Using standard `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Code Contributions

We follow a standard GitHub pull request workflow.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the [context-portal repository](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/context-portal).
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name
    ```
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
4.  **Write Tests:** If applicable, add tests for your changes.
5.  **Run Tests:** Ensure all tests pass. (Details on running tests TBD - you may want to add a section on testing).
6.  **Code Style:** Adhere to the project's code style (e.g., PEP 8). (Details on code formatting/linting TBD - you may want to add a section on this).
7.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
8.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
9.  **Open a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository's `main` branch. Provide a clear description of your changes.

### Building and Publishing Docker Images

If your contribution involves changes to the Docker image or you need to publish a new version, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Docker is Installed:** Make sure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
2.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    Navigate to the root of the `context-portal` repository and use the `build.ps1` script (for PowerShell users) or `docker build` command directly.

    Using `build.ps1` (recommended for Windows):
    ```powershell
    ./build.ps1
    ```
    This script handles building the image and tagging it appropriately.

    Manual Docker Build:
    ```bash
    docker build -t greatscottymac/context-portal-mcp:latest .
    # You can also tag with a specific version:
    # docker build -t greatscottymac/context-portal-mcp:vX.Y.Z .
    ```
3.  **Log in to Docker Hub:**
    Before pushing, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account from your terminal:
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```
    You will be prompted to enter your Docker ID and password.
4.  **Push the Docker Image:**
    After a successful build and login, push the image to Docker Hub:
    ```bash
    docker push greatscottymac/context-portal-mcp:latest
    # If you tagged with a specific version:
    # docker push greatscottymac/context-portal-mcp:vX.Y.Z
    ```
    This will upload the image to the `greatscottymac/context-portal-mcp` repository on Docker Hub.
5.  **Verify on Docker Hub:**
    Confirm that the image has been successfully pushed by checking your Docker Hub repository in your web browser.

### Documentation Improvements

Improving documentation is a valuable contribution! You can suggest changes by opening issues or submitting pull requests directly to the `docs/` or root Markdown files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.).
